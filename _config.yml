project_summary: This is my research into how APIs are being aggregated by service providers across the space. API aggregation comes in many forms, and focuses on many different business sectors, or categories of APIs. You can find news I've curated, organizations doing interesting things, some of the common building blocks I've identified, and open source tooling in this research report.
